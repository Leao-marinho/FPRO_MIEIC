Square Root

The square root of any non-negative number 
can be calculated using the following algorithm:

1. Calculate the midpoint of the interval [a, b] of possible values 
for the square root of the number;

2. If the midpoint is the solution or the limits of the interval agree 
at least on 5 decimal places, exit the iteration 
and return the solution obtained;

3. If the midpoint is greater than the solution, 
then define it as the new upper limit of the interval, 
otherwise define it as the new lower limit of the interval;

4. Iterate this process until the condition to exit is met.

Write a Python program that receives a float n, provided by the user, and calculates the square root by implementing the algorithm described.
