"""
Combinations

Write a Python function C that receives the number of objects to choose from n, 
the number of objects selected r and produces all combinations possible.

Remember the formula:
     n   
    C = (n!) / (r!(n-r)!)
     r


Round the result to the floor, 
for example the floor of 8.4 is 8 and the floor of 5.7 is 5. 

You cannot use the math package.
