N-th lowest

Write a Python function nth_lowest(lnum, n) 
that, given a list of numbers lnum and a positive integer n, 
returns the n-th lowest value in the list. 
Assume n always holds a valid value 
(i.e. does not include a number less or equal to one) 
and that the list never has repeated values.

for the list lnum=[42, 234, 135, 21, 232, 12312, -2343] and n=2, 
    the result is the number 21
    
for the list lnum=[73,100,23,18,84,61,56,75,92,38,54,73,3,13] and n=12, 
    the result is the number 84
