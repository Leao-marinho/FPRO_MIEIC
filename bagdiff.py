"""
Bagdiff

Write a Python function bagdiff(xs, ys) 
that returns items from the first list (xs) 
that are not eliminated by a matching element in the second list (ys). 
An item in the second list may "knock out" just one matching item 
in the first list.

Example:
    Input: 	[5, 7, 11, 11, 11, 12, 13], [7, 8, 11]	
    Output: [5, 11, 11, 12, 13]
