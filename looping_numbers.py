"""
Looping Numbers

A number is called a Looping Number if all adjacent digits in it differ by 1. 
The difference between 9 and 0 is considered as 1. 
All single digit numbers are considered looping numbers.

Write a Python program that receives an integer n, 
provided by the user, and checks whether the number is a jumping number or not. 
If the number is a looping number, print the message Looping number, 
otherwise print the message Not a looping number.

You can assume that all inputs are non-negative numbers.
