"""
Easy change

You're helping a teller decide how to give change. 
Write a Python script that given the price of the sale 
and the amount received by user input, 
then prints a string indicating how many notes of each amount 
they have to give as change. 
Consider that the largest note available is the 50â‚¬ note 
and that all prices and amounts received are multiples of 5 (no coins!).

The result should be a string with the number of notes of each amount, 
separated by a space: "#50 #20 #10 #5".

Hint: To help format the result, use type conversions to string.
