"""
Fibonacci numbers

Write a Python function fib(n) that returns a list 
of the first n Fibonacci numbers. 
The next number in a Fibonacci sequence 
is defined as the sum of the previous two numbers, 
and the first two numbers are defined as 0 and 1, respectively.

fib(1) should return the list: [0]
fib(5) should return the list: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
