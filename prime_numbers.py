"""
Prime numbers

Write a Python program that outputs all the prime numbers 
within a closed interval of numbers between lower and upper, 
given by user input.

For example:

for lower=2 and upper=23 the output is: 
    Prime numbers between 2 and 23 are: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23
    
for lower=5 and upper=27 the output is: 
    Prime numbers between 5 and 27 are: 5 7 11 13 17 19 23
    
for lower=-2 and upper=5 the output is: 
    Prime numbers between -2 and 5 are: 2 3 5
