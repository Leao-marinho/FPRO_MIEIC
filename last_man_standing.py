"""
Last Man Standing

In a circle of people, represented by a list of integers alist, 
a game will take place. 
Counting will start at the beginning of the list, 
and after counting a certain number of people, specified by step, 
the person where the counting stopped is out of the game.

Write a Python function last_man_standing(alist, step) 
that returns the last person left on the circle.

Example:
    Input: [3, 4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 7], 3	
    Output: 6
    
Order of elimination of people: 1, 5, 4, 2, 7, 2, 3
