"""
Greatest Member

Define a function greatest_member(atuple) 
that given a tuple atuple, returns the member of the tuple 
who has the highest score; 
for tiebreakers return the member that appears first in the tuple.

The score is calculated by summing the ASCII code of each character 
for every string the member contains.

A member can be either a string or another tuple. 
In the second case, the total score of the member 
is the sum of all scores of each sub-member.

If the initial tuple has no members, return an empty tuple.

Example:
    Input: ('hyde', 'jekyll')	
    Output: 'jekyll'
