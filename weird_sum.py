"""
Weird Sum 

Write a Python script that given two integers a and b, 
prints the value of their sum. 
However, if the difference of a and b is an even number, 
the value of the sum is doubled, on the other hand, 
if the difference is an odd number, 
the value of the product of a and b gets added to the value of the sum.

Do not use conditionals (e.g. if).
